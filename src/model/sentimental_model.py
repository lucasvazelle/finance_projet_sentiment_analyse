        We're implementing two pre-trained models
        to our webscrapped and preprocessed dataframe :

        The first one is "tarnformnet/Stock-Sentiment-BERT" model,
        which is a BERT-based model trained on stock market-related
        tweets for sentiment analysis.
        The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of tweets related to publicly
        traded companies and is able to predict the sentiment of tweets
        as either positive, negative, or neutral.

        The second one is  a pre-trained language model called "finBERT"
        that was developed by Prosus AI and made available through
        the Hugging Face library. It is a BERT model fine-tuned on financial
        domain-specific data, trained to do tasks such as
        sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.
        The model is trained on a large dataset of financial
        articles, news and SEC filings. The finBERT can be fine-tuned on
        specific financial tasks, and it can be used for a variety
        of NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition,
        and question answering.
