I understand xom goes by Exxon Mobil corp, not Exxon oil and gas. I feel as though Frank would mention if linked to Exxon although how do we explain the filing showing Exxon? Another company with almost identical name?

Either way doesn't mean it doesn't have huge potential

The last time a barrel of crude oil cost this much was in July 2014. At that point a gallon of gas only cost about $3.54.

Gasoline Price is function of:

Of course, I bought. I purchased 10 shares at $84.09, and an options contract at a $30.00 call at a current price of $54.10
