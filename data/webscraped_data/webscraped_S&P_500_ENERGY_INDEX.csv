Sep 28, 2022Friday, the S&P 500 stock index fell below its mid-June low of 3,666, wiping out the summer rebound. Fuelled by fears of rising inflation and global recession, the rout swept up bonds, energy, metals — pretty much everything except the U.S. dollar.

This has more to do with the outsized value creation in Tech and other sectors over the same period than a disconnect between WTI and Energy company value. The S&P 500 is an index, value is relative to its constituent market cap by company.

Aug 12, 2022The S&P 500's earnings increased 6.7% for Q2 2022, mostly driven by the energy sector. The index would be reporting a loss in earnings of 3.7% YoY if the sector were omitted.

Aug 12, 2022 6 of the S&P 500's 11 sectors have reported positive earnings growth in the quarter. But if we take energy out of the equation, the second quarter is a bit more dodgy.
‌ In fact, this growth rate of 6.7% would flip to a decline of 3.7% if energy were excluded from the index.

Elon Musk versus the Woke Cartel
Because of Elon Musk's attempt to take over Twitter, Tesla has been removed from the S&P's ESG Index, an action that exposes ESG for what it really is: a woke cartel.

In the S&P 500 there are 60 consumer discretionary companies and 21 energy companies.

I'm not arguing Exxon or Tesla should be in or out of ESG

I'm just discussing how the index is constructed to represent broad US market but favor companies with ESG characteristics.

important to note that as markets mature over long time periods, volatility should decrease.  Plus, the S&P 500 has evolved so much over past 40 years, since 1980 energy stocks went from ~25% of the index to 4%! This bear market could repeat history, but I’m more optimistic

Interestingly, that's less than the increase in 12m forward earnings - meaning the PE ratio of the sector has actually fallen.

It's now trading at a 42% discount to the index - in it's bottom percentile (since 1999).

This is a good point.  But a broad-based index is a collection of sectors you are 'picking.'  In 2006/2007 the S&P 500 had a large position in financials and energy.  In 2000 it was technology and telecoms.  You could have avoided the downside by picking better S&P 500 sectors.

Jan 5, 2022However:

“The WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO) posted a 2021 decline of 30%. However, it had outsized gains for two straight years: 58% in 2019 and a record-setting 203% in 2020. 

Aggregating the past three years, the ECO gained 232%, more than double the S&P 500’s 92%.”

Jan 5, 2022It's very telling to see the relative performance of fossil fuel stocks versus Green Energy stocks. In 2021 the S&P 500 Energy Index was up 48% while the S&P Clean Energy Index was DOWN by 24%. So much for ESG investment and the greening of our finance markets.

Dec 30, 2021Quite a different picture than a year ago!  S&P Energy Index was down 37% to the S&P 500's +15.7%.

Yes, 4% weighting is a long ways from energy's peak 16% in 2008. Those days aren't coming back. But investors also haven't abandoned oil and gas for good, as some feared last year.

Yes, but when energy falls from 10% of S&P 500 to 3% of S&P 500, the fall in everyone's portfolio compared to the fall in the energy sector vs. the rest of the market is equal. Someone will still be overweight the sector vs the index and someone will be underweight.

Warren Buffet recommends S&P 500 index funds like SPY for passive investors. Over the past decade it has averaged a yearly 14% CAGR. Tesla has given me 1000%+ returns. But it’s volatile & speculative at its current valuation. Renewable energy & EV sectors are very profitable now.",,,

In hindsight, that was the peak as Oil hit $150 per barrel.

Oct 28, 2020Energy has become about as irrelevant for the S&P 500 Index’s value as any industry has been in decades. The group’s S&P 500 weight fell to a closing low of 1.96% Wednesday. The reading was the lowest for oil and gas stocks since at least 1989.

Oil names set to lead today's rally (based on pre-market action) as oil benchmarks slip#OOTT

Is the latest rotation into cyclical value stocks like energy names jumping the gun a little?

Jun 4, 20201/ Yes, you're reading this right: so deep was the more-than-halving in the S&P 500 Energy index in the Feb-March crash that it has returned 75.6% since the lows. But the sector has become so tiny that it can't ""move the S&P 500's needle"" like some other sectors.

Bad take. When you’re young is the best time to invest actually. Right now you can just buy an S&P 500 index fund and you’ll be in good shape. Sector wise tech is still king, and energy obviously has tremendous growth potential. If you can get in now you’ll be glad you did.

Markets already decided 

Energy has been the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 in recent years, so it has paid to avoid fossil fuel stocks. noting that oil and gas companies now account for just 4.4% of the S&P 500, while in 1980 they represented more than 28% of the index.

Index Funds & ETFs are great for a passive investor! You can invest in a stock index (S&P 500) or in whole markets (green energy, health care). I don't like actively managed Mutual Funds; they incur higher costs, but fail to justify those costs with consistently higher returns.
