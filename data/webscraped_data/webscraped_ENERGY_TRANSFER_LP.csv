Got curious. I count 7. Besides the obvious ones (Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla and Cisco), there’s Centene and Energy Transfer LP. Others “founded” in the last 40 years are mostly mergers, breakups and spin-offs from existing companies.

Financials are real, masked by a random number

As usual, make an intrinsic value/sh est, trading px (if inclined), and an industry guess

DM if you think you know the co.

Will compile and reveal the name on Sunday evening.

Good luck!
