Sep 30, 2021It's an honor to receive this. It carries added meaning for me in that the history of the Weyerhaeuser Co. is so closely bound up with Japan's empire of forestry 

Anyone care to guess when that relationship begins? 

(Hint: its a year that ""shook"" the trans-Pacific timber trade)

I worked for a co that supplies paper companies yrs ago, the pres of Weyerhaeuser was a reg in our office and he talked a lot about how to maintain forests.  (removing trees, planting 7:1, etc) The Sierra Nevada club lobbied hard against removing any trees and brush, apparently.
