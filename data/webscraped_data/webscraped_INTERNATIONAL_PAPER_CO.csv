Agreed! For decades, the mere sight (& smell!!) of International Paper Co. (the world's largest paper & pulp maker, before closing in 2009) would scare *everyone* on I-5 from the mere *thought* of visiting Albany. But the air's clear now! Fill in those *awful* empty parking lots!",,,

In the 1980s International Paper Co had a series of print ads on how to write various things, each essay was penned by a accomplished writer. Vonnegut wrote, How To Write With Style. I loved it and kept it. You can get a pdf online if you search.
