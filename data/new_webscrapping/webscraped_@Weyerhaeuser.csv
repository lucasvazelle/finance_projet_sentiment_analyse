 wants you to imagine that its forests  reduce warming by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. 

Reality: Forests have a net warming effect b/c dark forests reduce the amount of UV radiation reflected back to space. https://junkscience.com/2019/10/trump-to-cool-planet-by-lifting-logging-restrictions-in-alaska/…",7,14,72

 says it will stop logging only if someone buys its offsets.
