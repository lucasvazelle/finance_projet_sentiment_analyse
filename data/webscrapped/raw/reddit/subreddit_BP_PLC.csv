I'm gonna have a job shadowing/externship/coffee chat in a couple days with some Electrical, Instrumentation and Process control, and Reliability Engineers in an oil refinery. This is pretty much my first experience in the field as a student (I only have some ELEC and a bit of control theory background). Therefore I've been doing my research about the field and how those areas are applied in a refinery. However, I wanted to ask you guys if you have any ideas of cool questions to ask to have a more interesting talk with the experts, be it either directly related to the topic or even if it takes a bit more of a tangent.;

u/newbieatthegym;BP's 2021 Forecast (from 1st Quarter results);il y a 3 a;BP's 2021 Forecast (from 1st Quarter results) Source: https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-first-quarter-2021-results.pdf For 2021: In the second quarter, bp intends to offset the expected full-year dilution from the vesting of awards under employee share schemes through buybacks, at a cost of around $500 million. Subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, the board is committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for buybacks, planning to allocate the remaining 40% to further strengthen the balance sheet and support our strong investment grade credit rating. During the first quarter, bp generated surplus cash flow of $1.7 billion after having reached its net debt target of $35 billion. During the second quarter, cash flow is expected to be impacted by the $1.2 billion pre-tax annual Gulf of Mexico oil spill payment, further severance payments and a smaller improvement in realized refining margins relative to the quarter to date rise in our RMM*. As a result of these factors we expect a cash flow deficit in the second quarter. In the second half of the year bp expects to generate surplus cash flow above an oil price of around $45 per barrel with an RMM of around $13 per barrel and Henry Hub of $3 per mmBtu.;

Subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, the board is committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for buybacks, planning to allocate the remaining 40% to further strengthen the balance sheet and support our strong investment grade credit rating. During the first quarter, bp generated surplus cash flow of $1.7 billion after having reached its net debt target of $35 billion. During the second quarter, cash flow is expected to be impacted by the $1.2 billion pre-tax annual Gulf of Mexico oil spill payment, further severance payments and a smaller improvement in realized refining margins relative to the quarter to date rise in our RMM*. As a result of these factors we expect a cash flow deficit in the second quarter.

I'm gonna have a job shadowing/externship/coffee chat in a couple days with some Electrical, Instrumentation and Process control, and Reliability Engineers in an oil refinery. This is pretty much my first experience in the field as a student (I only have some ELEC and a bit of control theory background). Therefore I've been doing my research about the field and how those areas are applied in a refinery. However, I wanted to ask you guys if you have any ideas of cool questions to ask to have a more interesting talk with the experts, be it either directly related to the topic or even if it takes a bit more of a tangent.;

I'm gonna have a job shadowing/externship/coffee chat in a couple days with some Electrical, Instrumentation and Process control, and Reliability Engineers in an oil refinery. This is pretty much my first experience in the field as a student (I only have some ELEC and a bit of control theory background). Therefore I've been doing my research about the field and how those areas are applied in a refinery. However, I wanted to ask you guys if you have any ideas of cool questions to ask to have a more interesting talk with the experts, be it either directly related to the topic or even if it takes a bit more of a tangent.;

Subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, the board is committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for buybacks, planning to allocate the remaining 40% to further strengthen the balance sheet and support our strong investment grade credit rating. During the first quarter, bp generated surplus cash flow of $1.7 billion after having reached its net debt target of $35 billion. During the second quarter, cash flow is expected to be impacted by the $1.2 billion pre-tax annual Gulf of Mexico oil spill payment, further severance payments and a smaller improvement in realized refining margins relative to the quarter to date rise in our RMM*. As a result of these factors we expect a cash flow deficit in the second quarter. In the second half of the year bp expects to generate surplus cash flow above an oil price of around $45 per barrel with an RMM of around $13 per barrel and Henry Hub of $3 per mmBtu.;
